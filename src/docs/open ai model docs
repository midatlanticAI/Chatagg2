|Deprecated|A full list of models that have been deprecated along with the suggested replacement|

For GPT-series models, the context window refers to the maximum number of tokens that can be used in a single request, inclusive of both input and output tokens.

We have also published open source models including [Point-E](https://github.com/openai/point-e), [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), [Jukebox](https://github.com/openai/jukebox), and [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP).

Continuous model upgrades
-------------------------

`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo` point to their respective latest model version. You can verify this by looking at the [response object](/docs/api-reference/chat/object) after sending a request. The response will include the specific model version used (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`). The `chatgpt-4o-latest` model version continuously points to the version of GPT-4o used in [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), and is updated frequently, when there are significant changes. With the exception of `chatgpt-4o-latest`, we offer pinned model versions that developers can continue using for at least three months after an updated model has been introduced.

Learn more about model deprecation on our [deprecation page](/docs/deprecations).

GPT-4o
------

GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced GPT model. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), and it has the same high intelligence as GPT-4 Turbo but is much more efficient—it generates text 2x faster and is 50% cheaper. Additionally, GPT-4o has the best vision and performance across non-English languages of any of our models. GPT-4o is available in the OpenAI API to paying customers. Learn how to use GPT-4o in our [text generation guide](/docs/guides/text-generation).

GPT-4o mini
-----------

GPT-4o mini (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced model in the small models category, and our cheapest model yet. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), has higher intelligence than `gpt-3.5-turbo` but is just as fast. It is meant to be used for smaller tasks, including vision tasks.

We recommend choosing `gpt-4o-mini` where you would have previously used `gpt-3.5-turbo` as this model is more capable and cheaper.

o1-preview and o1-mini

Beta

--------------------------------

The **o1 series** of large language models are trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. o1 models think before they answer, producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user.  
Learn about the capabilities and limitations of o1 models in our [reasoning guide](/docs/guides/reasoning).

There are two model types available today:

*   **o1-preview**: reasoning model designed to solve hard problems across domains.
*   **o1-mini**: faster and cheaper reasoning model particularly good at coding, math, and science.

GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4
---------------------

GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of our previous models, thanks to its broader general knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. GPT-4 is available in the OpenAI API to [paying customers](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4). Like `gpt-3.5-turbo`, GPT-4 is optimized for chat but works well for traditional completions tasks using the [Chat Completions API](/docs/api-reference/chat). Learn how to use GPT-4 in our [text generation guide](/docs/guides/text-generation).

|Model|Context window|Max output tokens|Knowledge cutoff|

|gpt-4-0314LegacySnapshot of gpt-4 from March 14th 2023.|8,192 tokens|8,192 tokens|Sep 2021|

For many basic tasks, the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models is not significant. However, in more complex reasoning situations, GPT-4 is much more capable than any of our previous models.

#### Multilingual capabilities

GPT-4 [outperforms both previous large language models](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) and as of 2023, most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark, an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages.

GPT-3.5 Turbo
-------------

GPT-3.5 Turbo models can understand and generate natural language or code and have been optimized for chat using the [Chat Completions API](/docs/api-reference/chat) but work well for non-chat tasks as well.

As of July 2024, `gpt-4o-mini` should be used in place of `gpt-3.5-turbo`, as it is cheaper, more capable, multimodal, and just as fast. `gpt-3.5-turbo` is still available for use in the API.

DALL·E
------

DALL·E is a AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. DALL·E 3 currently supports the ability, given a prompt, to create a new image with a specific size. DALL·E 2 also support the ability to edit an existing image, or create variations of a user provided image.

[DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) is available through our [Images API](/docs/guides/images) along with [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta). You can try DALL·E 3 through [ChatGPT Plus](https://chatgpt.com).

|Model|Description|
|---|---|
|dall-e-3|The latest DALL·E model released in Nov 2023. Learn more.|
|dall-e-2|The previous DALL·E model released in Nov 2022. The 2nd iteration of DALL·E with more realistic, accurate, and 4x greater resolution images than the original model.|

TTS
---

TTS is an AI model that converts text to natural sounding spoken text. We offer two different model variates, `tts-1` is optimized for real time text to speech use cases and `tts-1-hd` is optimized for quality. These models can be used with the [Speech endpoint in the Audio API](/docs/guides/text-to-speech).

|Model|Description|
|---|---|
|tts-1|The latest text to speech model, optimized for speed.|
|tts-1-hd|The latest text to speech model, optimized for quality.|

Whisper
-------

Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification. The Whisper v2-large model is currently available through our API with the `whisper-1` model name.

Currently, there is no difference between the [open source version of Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and the version available through our API. However, [through our API](/docs/guides/speech-to-text), we offer an optimized inference process which makes running Whisper through our API much faster than doing it through other means. For more technical details on Whisper, you can [read the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356).

Embeddings
----------

Embeddings are a numerical representation of text that can be used to measure the relatedness between two pieces of text. Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, and classification tasks. You can read more about our latest embedding models in the [announcement blog post](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates).

|Model|Output Dimension|
|---|---|
|text-embedding-3-largeMost capable embedding model for both english and non-english tasks|3,072|
|text-embedding-3-smallIncreased performance over 2nd generation ada embedding model|1,536|
|text-embedding-ada-002Most capable 2nd generation embedding model, replacing 16 first generation models|1,536|

How we use your data
--------------------

Your data is your data.

As of March 1, 2023, data sent to the OpenAI API will not be used to train or improve OpenAI models (unless you explicitly opt-in to share data with us, such as by [providing feedback in the Playground](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9883556-providing-feedback-in-the-api-playground)). One advantage to opting in is that the models may get better at your use case over time.

To help identify abuse, API data may be retained for up to 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law). For trusted customers with sensitive applications, zero data retention may be available. With zero data retention, request and response bodies are not persisted to any logging mechanism and exist only in memory in order to serve the request.

Note that this data policy does not apply to OpenAI's non-API consumer services like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [DALL·E Labs](https://labs.openai.com/).
